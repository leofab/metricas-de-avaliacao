# Evaluation Metrics from Confusion Matrix

This project uses [***thumarbrijesh@gmail.com Confusion Matrix***](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1S9ThhinDflxU4KmTdxcv6_mE_vWwk2Jk#scrollTo=QOIbCQ3T9bml) notebook for extracting evaluation metrics utilizing libs like pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn.


- Uses MNIST dataset for deep learning models identifying hand written numbers.
- Plots heatmap for each class and its prediction.
- uses metrics module from sklearn lib to extract accuracy, sensibility, precision, f-score and roc score
- plots roc curve in OvR (one vs rest) for each class individualy
